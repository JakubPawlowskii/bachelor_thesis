abstract = {We discuss the energy current and the energy fluctuations in an isolated quantum wire driven far from equilibrium. The system consists of interacting spinless fermions and is driven by a time--dependent magnetic flux. The energy current is defined by the continuity equation for the energy density which is derived both for homogeneous as well as for inhomogeneous systems. Since the total energy is not conserved in the driven system, the continuity equation includes the source terms which are shown to represent the Joule heating effects. For short times and weak drivings the energy current agrees with the linear response theory. For stronger fields or longer times of driving the system enters the quasiequilibrium regime when the energy current gradually diminishes due to the heating effects. Finally, for even stronger driving the energy current is shown to undergo a damped Bloch oscillations. The energy spread also increases upon driving. However, the time--dependence of this quantity in the low field regime is quite unexpected since it is determined mostly by the time of driving being quite independent of the instantaneous energy of the system.},

abstract = {Even though the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) may be introduced as an extension of the random matrix theory, physical Hamiltonians and observables differ from random operators. One of the challenges is to embed local integrals of motion (LIOMs) within the ETH. Here we make steps towards a unified treatment of the ETH in integrable and nonintegrable models with translational invariance. Specifically, we focus on the impact of LIOMs on the fluctuations and structure of the diagonal matrix elements of local observables. We first show that nonvanishing fluctuations entail the presence of LIOMs. Then we introduce a generic protocol to construct observables, subtracted by their projections on LIOMs as well as products of LIOMs. The protocol systematically reduces fluctuations and/or the structure of the diagonal matrix elements. We verify our arguments by numerical results for integrable and nonintegrable models.},

abstract = {We develop a numerical algorithm for identifying approximately conserved quantities in models perturbed away from integrability. In the long-time regime, these quantities fully determine correlation functions of local observables. Applying the algorithm to the perturbed XXZ model, we find that the main effect of perturbation consists in expanding the support of conserved quantities. This expansion follows quadratic dependence on the strength of perturbation. The latter result, together with correlation functions of conserved quantities obtained from the memory function analysis, confirms the feasibility of the perturbation theory.},

@article{Srednicki1994,
abstract = {We show that a bounded, isolated quantum system of many particles in a specific initial state will approach thermal equilibrium if the energy eigenfunctions which are superposed to form that state obey Berry's conjecture. Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were Gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O(Latin small letter h with stroke/$\Delta$)t-1, where $\Delta$ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a sound foundation for quantum statistical mechanics. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Garrison2018,
abstract = {The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits that the reduced density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is "thermal." Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: For which class of operators, local or nonlocal, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: Is the Hamiltonian of a system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH where, in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as the subsystem size is much less than the total system size, irrespective of how large the subsystem is compared to any intrinsic length scale of the system. This allows one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy densities (or temperatures) using just a single eigenstate. We provide support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a nonintegrable 1D quantum lattice model with only energy conservation. In addition, we examine the case in which the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the total system size, and we find that, even in this case, many operators continue to match their canonical expectation values, at least approximately. In particular, the von Neumann entanglement entropy equals the thermal entropy as long as the subsystem is less than half the total system. Our results are consistent with the possibility that a single eigenstate correctly predicts the expectation values of all operators with support on less than half the total system, as long as one uses a microcanonical ensemble with vanishing energy width for comparison. We also study, both analytically and numerically, a particle-number conserving model at infinite temperature that substantiates our conjectures.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

abstract = {A continuous family of quasilocal exact conservation laws is constructed in the anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) spin-1/2 chain for periodic (or twisted) boundary conditions and for a set of commensurate anisotropies densely covering the entire easy plane interaction regime. All local conserved operators follow from the standard (Hermitian) transfer operator in fundamental representation (with auxiliary spin s = 1/2), and are all even with respect to a spin flip operation. However, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a non-Hermitian highest weight transfer operator with respect to a complex auxiliary spin representation parameter s and includes also operators of odd parity. For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives of quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators localized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations) we propose a simple explicit construction of infinite time averages of local operators such as the spin current. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Even though the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) may be introduced as an extension of the random matrix theory, physical Hamiltonians and observables differ from random operators. One of the challenges is to embed local integrals of motion (LIOMs) within the ETH. Here we make steps towards a unified treatment of the ETH in integrable and nonintegrable models with translational invariance. Specifically, we focus on the impact of LIOMs on the fluctuations and structure of the diagonal matrix elements of local observables. We first show that nonvanishing fluctuations entail the presence of LIOMs. Then we introduce a generic protocol to construct observables, subtracted by their projections on LIOMs as well as products of LIOMs. The protocol systematically reduces fluctuations and/or the structure of the diagonal matrix elements. We verify our arguments by numerical results for integrable and nonintegrable models.},

@article{Grabowski1995,
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the structure of the conservation laws in quantum integrable chains of the XYZ-type and in the Hubbard model. The essential tool for the former class of models is the boost operator, which provides a recursive way of calculating the integrals of motion. With its help, we establish the general form of the XYZ conserved charges in terms of simple polynomials in spin variables and derive recursion relations for the relative coefficients of these polynomials. Although these relations are difficult to solve in general, a subset of the coefficients can be determined. Moreover, for two submodels of the XYZ chain, namely the XXX and XY cases, all the charges can be calculated in closed form. Using this approach, we rederive the known expressions for the XY charges in a novel way. For the XXX case, a simple description of conserved charges is found in terms of a Catalan tree. This construction is generalized for the su(M) invariant integrable drain. We also investigate the circumstances permitting the existence of a recursive (ladder) operator in general quantum integrable systems. We indicate that a quantum ladder operator can be traced back to the presence of a hamiltonian mastersymmetry of degree one in the classical continuous version of the model. In this way, quantum chains endowed with a recursive structure can be identified from the the properties of their classical relatives. We also show that in the quantum continuous limits of the XYZ model, the ladder property of the boost operator disappears. For the Hubbard model we demonstrate the non-existence of a ladder operator. Nevertheless, the general structure of the conserved charges is indicated, and the expression for the terms linear in the model′s free parameter for all charges is derived in closed form. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press.},

As a consequence, the additional charges must be included in the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the stationary properties. The effects go well beyond a simple redefinition of the stationary state. The time evolution of a non-translation-invariant state under a (translation-invariant) Hamiltonian with a perturbation that weakly breaks the hidden symmetries underlying the extra conservation laws exhibits pre-relaxation.

It is by now well established that the stiffnesses of spin and charge currents reveal, at high temperatures, a discontinuous reduction (jump) when the interaction is introduced. We show that the jumps are related to the large degeneracy of the parent noninteracting models and, more generally, can appear in other integrable models with macroscopic degeneracies. These degeneracies are properly captured by the degenerate perturbation calculations which may be performed for large systems. We find that the discontinuities and the quasilocality of the conserved current in this limit can be traced back to the nonlocal character of an effective interaction.

We employ the so-called quantum Markovian semi-group evolution, i.e. a general form of time-autonomous positivity and trace-preserving dynamical equation for reduced density operators, by only allowing unitarity-breaking dissipative terms acting at the boundaries of a system. Such setup enables to simulate macroscopic reservoirs for different values of effective thermodynamic potentials, causing incoherent transitions between quantum states which are modeled with aid of the Lindblad operators. This serves as a simple minimalistic model for studying quantum transport properties, either in the linear response domain or in more general regimes far from canonical equilibrium. We are mainly exploring possibilities of identifying nonequilibrium situations which are amenable to exact description within matrix product state representation, by exclusively focusing on steady states, i.e. fixed points of the Lindblad equation, of certain prototypic interacting integrable spin chains driven by incoherent polarizing processes. Finally, we define a concept of pseudo-local extensive almost-conserved quantities by allowing a violation of time-invariance up to boundary-localized terms. We elucidate the role of such quantities on non-ergodic behaviour of temporal correlation functions rendering anomalous transport properties. It turns out that such conservation laws can be generated by means of boundary universal quantum transfer operators of the fundamental integrable models.},

These changes are due to non-equilibrium light-induced diamagnetic moments of quasi-free electrons of narrow d-subbands of the MnAs-conduction band.

We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations) we propose a simple explicit construction of infinite time averages of local operators such as the spin current. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Even though the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) may be introduced as an extension of the random matrix theory, physical Hamiltonians and observables differ from random operators. One of the challenges is to embed local integrals of motion (LIOMs) within the ETH. Here we make steps towards a unified treatment of the ETH in integrable and nonintegrable models with translational invariance. Specifically, we focus on the impact of LIOMs on the fluctuations and structure of the diagonal matrix elements of local observables. We first show that nonvanishing fluctuations entail the presence of LIOMs. Then we introduce a generic protocol to construct observables, subtracted by their projections on LIOMs as well as products of LIOMs. The protocol systematically reduces fluctuations and/or the structure of the diagonal matrix elements. We verify our arguments by numerical results for integrable and nonintegrable models.},

The central concept are the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

abstract = {This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, the fluctuation–dissipation relation, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. In some cases, it is possible to extend their regimes of applicability beyond the standard thermal equilibrium domain. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We present results from numerical experiments and analytical studies of quantum quenches at integrability.

We show that one of these approaches can be utilized for constructing local, conserved, Majorana fermions in systems with an arbitrary many-body interaction. As a test case, we first investigate a noninteracting Kitaev model and demonstrate that this approach perfectly reproduces the standard results. Then, we discuss how the many-body interactions influence the spatial structure and the lifetime of the Majorana modes. Finally, we determine the regime for which the information stored in the Majorana correlators is also retained for arbitrarily long times at high temperatures. We show that it is included in the regime with topologically protected soft Majorana modes, but in some cases is significantly smaller.},
