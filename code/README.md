# Local and quasi-local integrals of motion
Program generating all local and quasi-local integrals of motion for spinless fermion model and XXZ model, that do not commute with particle number operator or total Sz operator.

In Results folder there is some generated data so far, and some python scripts for data post-processing and plotting.

Code written as a part of my Bachelor thesis.
