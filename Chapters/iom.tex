\chapter{Integrals of motion}
\thispagestyle{chapterBeginStyle}

\paragraph{}The problem of our interest is the systematic classification of all local and quasilocal integrals of
motion (LIOMs and QLIOMs) supported on \(\NN \ni m \leq L/2\) sites. To this end, we employ the algorithm first proposed
in~\textcite{Mierzejewski2015a}. The aim of this thesis is to provide a pedagogical introduction to the topic, 
so all derivations are presented in full detail, together with a simple proof of correctness for the algorithm.


\section{Preliminaries}

\paragraph{}We begin with a definition of integral of motion in quantum mechanics.
\begin{definition}
  Let \(H\) be a Hamiltonian operator. Then, any observable \(O\) fulfilling the equation:
  \[
    \comm{H}{O} = 0
  \]
  is an integral of motion.\label{def:iom}
\end{definition}
It is easy to see, that there are many such observables. Let us consider the following
\begin{example}
  Take \(H\) to be any Hamiltonian operator. By spectral theorem, it can be written is diagonal form:
  \begin{equation*}
    H = \sum_n E_n \ketbra{n}{n}
  \end{equation*}
  Then a set of projection operators \(P_n = \ketbra{n}{n}\) is a family of IOMs.
  Eigenstates of a Hamiltonian are in general very nonlocal. \label{ex: projectors}
\end{example}
However, as it will become evident in Section~\ref{sec:spectral function} on spectral function, nonlocal operators are not important in the
thermodynamic limit and we are only interested in the so called local (or quasilocal) integrals of motion.
A working intuition behind local operators is perhaps best seen in Figure~\ref{fig:1D chain}. They can be thought of as
being different from identity only on \(m\) consecutive sites. XXZ Hamiltonian defined by equation~\eqref{eq:HXXZ} is an
example of 2-local operator.

\section{(Q)LIOMs finding algorithm \label{sec:algorithm}}
  \paragraph{}Consider the vector space \(\mathcal{V}_L\) of traceless and translationally invariant observables, acting on a Hilbert space of dimension \(2^L\). We can define an inner
  product on this space:
  \begin{equation}
      \left(A|B\right) = \frac{1}{2^L}\tr(A^{\dagger}B) = \frac{1}{2^L} \sum_{mn} A_{nm}B_{nm}^{\ast}
  \end{equation}
  i.e. the Hilbert-Schmidt product, where \(A_{nm} = \matrixel{n}{A}{m}\) and \(H\ket{n} = E_n \ket{n}\). This definition is correct, as we work only with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We require the operators to be traceless, becauese they
  have zero overlap with the identity, \(\left(A|\Id\right)=\frac{1}{2^L}\tr(A) = 0\).
  
  
  
  Now we introduce an orthonormal basis of \({\mathcal{A}_L^m}\):
  \begin{equation}
      O_{\underline{s} } = \sum_{j = 1}^L \sigma_{j}^{s_1}\sigma_{j+1}^{s_2}\cdots \sigma_{j+m-1}^{s_m}
  \end{equation}
  where \(\sigma^z_j \equiv \sqrt{2}S^{z}_j\), \(\sigma^{\pm}_j \equiv S^{\pm}_j\), \(\sigma^0_j\equiv \Id\), \(\underline{s} = (s_1,s_2,\ldots s_m)\)
  and \(s_j \in \{+,-,z,0\}\) while \(s_{1,m} \in \{+,-,z\}\). For a fixed m, there are exactly \(N_m = 3\cdot 4^{m-2}\cdot 3\) such operators and they
  satisfy an orthonormality condition i.e \(\left(O_{\underline{s}}|O_{\underline{s'}}\right) = \delta_{\underline{s},\underline{s'}}\). 
  
  We define the infinite time averaging of an operator \(A\in \mathcal{A}_L^m\), employing the Heisenberg picture:
  \begin{align}
  \overline{A} = &\lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int dt\, A_{H}(t) =  \nonumber
  \lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int dt\, e^{i H t}A e^{-i H t} = \\ \nonumber
  &\sum_{n,m} \lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int dt\, e^{i E_m t}\ket{m}  
  \matrixel{m}{A}{n}\bra{n}  e^{-i E_n t} = \\ 
  & \sum_{n,m} \matrixel{m}{A}{n}\ketbra{m}{n} \lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\tau}
  \int dt \, e^{i(E_m-E_n)t} =  \sum_{n,m}^{E_n = E_m} \matrixel{m}{A}{n}\ketbra{m}{n}
  \label{eq:time_avg}
  \end{align}
  It is evident from equation~\eqref{eq:time_avg} that large degeneracy of energy spectrum will be important to the
  structure of time-averaged operators. Moreover, time averaging in such form is an orthogonal projection in the
  Hilbert space of operators. From that follows a crucial property i.e \(\left(\overline{A}|\overline{B}\right) = 
  \left(\overline{A}|B\right)\).
