        \item integrability of Heisenberg model for \(\alpha = 0.0 \) is Bethe ansatz?
        \item sources for motivation and history in intro
        \item best way to introduce Heisenberg model?
        \item where was the algorithm first proposed?
        \item source for nonlocal operators stiffness vanishing in thermodynamic limit
        \item is extrapolation with 1/L just finite size scaling?
        \item is the algorithm valid for any quantum lattice model?
