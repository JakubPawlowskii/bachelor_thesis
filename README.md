# Non-commuting integrals of motion in XXZ model

This is a repository for my Bachelor Thesis, written under supervision of prof. Marcin Mierzejewski during my Quantum Engineering degree at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
The purpose of this thesis is the investigation of time decay of local conserved quantities in
XXZ model in presence of integrability breaking perturbation.
