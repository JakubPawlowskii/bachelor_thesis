# Non-commuting integrals of motion in XXZ model

This is a repository for my Bachelor Thesis, written under supervision of prof. Marcin Mierzejewski during my Quantum Engineering degree at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
The purpose of this thesis is the investigation of time decay of local conserved quantities in
XXZ model in presence of integrability breaking perturbation.

Folder `thesis` contains LaTex manuscript and final plots. Folder `code` contains C++ source code, some outputs and Python scripts for data processing and plotting.
